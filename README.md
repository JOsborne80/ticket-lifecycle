<h2>Lifecycle Stages</h2>


<p>
Hi guys! 

Today I have my third project here on github. 

I am going to walk through the lifecycle of a ticket (osTicket) in my virtual enviroment.I will  make a ticket, assign it to an agent, work a ticket, and work with a collegue to find a resolution. 

First we will create a couple of tickets as an end user. 
Go to the support center to open a new ticket.

Above we see our user karen made a general inquiry. She wants to know when they are getting new hardware because her department is having issues with the old tablets. 
 
 The ticket was successfully created. I made a few other tickets so we can have a few tickets in the queue. 
 
 We will now log in as an aministrator and make some agents to work these tickets. 
Below you can see that I put Jane Doe in the system admin department at level of supreme admin. I also gave them extended access as supreme admin. I am just making sure we can have the rights to modify and assign these tickets to agents.

<p>

If we go to the tickets tab under Agent panel we can see our tickets that were created. 


If we click on ticket#278044 you can see the details of the ticket.

We will now change the priority to Emergency because the issue has a major busisness impact.

I will now assign this ticket to jane.doe who is an agent on our team (escalation engineer).

<p>

Next I will change the SLA ( service level agreement) to SEV-A because it is a business impacting critical event.

<p>

Here if we look at the ticket you can clearly see that any alterations made are now logged and attached to the ticket. You can also see that the prority level is alerting us that is an emergency!

<p>

I am now working on the ticket and decide to transfer to the System Admin department. The transfer to the System Administrators is because they are in charge of mobile banking infrastructure.The SMEs on this team posses the skills needed to resolve this ticket. The osticket dashboard shows the transfer reply posted successfully.

<p>
You may view every modification or comment attached to the ticket. The ticket activity log gives you a good idea of what has already happen and how you can help.
